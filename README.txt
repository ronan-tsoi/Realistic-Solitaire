Solitaire Project

!!!
My code right now is a MESS sorry if it's kind of impossible to read right now 
!!!

If I'm being totally honest I have really had trouble finding time to work on this project because of a lot of my due dates for assignments from CSE101 being piled on this week in addition to officer responsibilities for extracurricular clubs I'm involved with (mainly GDA since we had a major sprint deadline for playtesting our mock studio game this Friday).

I'm planning on working quite a bit more within the next week on the project to submit the completed version by April 24th (Thursday). 

Currently the project has a card class that allows individual cards to be dragged by the player by holding down left click. My next steps were to create a stack class that from which cards could be placed and removed from in addition to adding a framework for individual card data i.e. suit, number, status of the card as either face up or face down.
