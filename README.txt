NOTE:
The game checks for valid plays but does not (currently) store the original location of the card.
This means that you can get softlocked if you move the top card off of a tableau without an existing valid position.

Programming Patterns- I would need to refactor my code for it to actually properly fit these programming patterns, but it is reminiscient of something that utilizes a flyweight pattern for the cards and their associated values for suits/number, states for cards and piles to determine player actions, and components throughout the program.
